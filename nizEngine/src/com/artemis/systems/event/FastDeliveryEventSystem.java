/**
 * A special type of event system. That ensures fast delivery
 * of events. When an event is added to the buffer, it is
 * automatically added to the currentEvents. This avoids having
 * to wait a cycle to process most current events. The downside of
 * using this system is that the sending and the retrieving of
 * the events is slightly slower.
 * 
 * Since the systems are processed in sequence, if an event gets
 * added to the event system that another system cares about but
 * has already been processed in the current cycle, we ensure
 * that that system still receives the event, but all other
 * systems that have already processed said event don't.
